# Airbnb Pricing Strategy Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

This project analyzes a cleaned Airbnb dataset to identify key metrics that impact listing prices and total revenue. The goal of this project is to understand the key factors drivering revenue and provide insights for hosts to optimize their pricing strategy.

This analysis is part of a project on Airbnb pricing strategy to optimise factors affecting pricing and maximizing revenue. The main Python script (`analysis.py`) performs data loading, feature engineering (creating a `revenue` column), and generates a series of visualizations to uncover key relationships.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. What Drives Price and Revenue?
The correlation heatmap shows that `accommodates`, `bathrooms`, and `bedrooms` are strongly and positively correlated with both `price` and `revenue`. This confirms that **incrementing these properties generate significantly more revenue**.

### 2. The Value of Being a "Guest Favourite"
There is a clear and significant financial benefit to being a "Guest Favourite." On average, these listings earn substantially more revenue, highlighting the importance of investing in guest experience and quality.

### 3. Finding the Revenue "Sweet Spot"
This project's core goal is to find the optimal price.
* **Demand Curve (Price vs. Sales)**: As expected, as `price` increases, the number of `sales` (bookings) tends to decrease.
* **Revenue Optimization Curve (Price vs. Revenue)**: This plot shows the relationship between price and total revenue. The red trendline illustrates that while revenue initially rises with price, it eventually flattens and will fall. **The peak of this curve represents the optimal price point that maximizes total revenue.**
